## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Activate the System
1. Go to WordPress Admin Dashboard
2. Create a new page called "Pipeline"
3. Set the page template to "User Dashboard Pipeline"
4. Publish the page

The database tables will be created automatically when you visit the page for the first time.

### Step 2: Add Whitelisted Users
Since the system is access-controlled, you need to add users who can access it:

Option A - Make yourself admin (already has access):
- Administrators have automatic access

Option B - Add specific users to whitelist:
1. Navigate to Pipeline → Whitelisted Users
2. Select users from the dropdown
3. Click "Add User"

### Step 3: Configure Field Options
1. Go to Pipeline → Field Management
2. Customize dropdown options for:
   - Lead Sources
   - Property Types
   - Budget Payment Methods
   - Purpose of Purchase
   - Timeline & Urgency
   - Stage in Buying Process

### Step 4: Configure Person in Charge
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Houzez Options
2. Find the "partnership_field_person_in_charge" option
3. Add names (one per line) of sales people

## Remaining Files to Create

I'll provide the code for the remaining template files. You can create these files manually:

## System Workflow

     - Lead moves to Deals tab

3. **Deal Management**
   - Add buyer requirements (property type, budget, location, etc.)
   - Update deal status as it progresses
   - When status = "For Payment":
     - Automatically creates Invoice record
     - Deal moves to Invoices tab

4. **Invoice Generation**
   - Auto-generates unique invoice number
   - Fills data from lead and partnership
   - Calculates referral fee automatically

## Next Steps

1. **Create the remaining template files** (deals, invoices, reports, field-management, whitelist)
2. **Implement PDF generation** for invoices using TCPDF or similar library
3. **Add charts** to reports page using Chart.js
4. **Test the complete workflow** from lead to invoice
5. **Add email notifications** for status changes (optional)
6. **Implement Excel export** for reports (optional)

## Technologies Used

- **WordPress AJAX** - All CRUD operations
- **jQuery** - Client-side interactions
- **MySQL** - Database
- **Select2** (optional) - Better multi-select dropdowns
- **Chart.js** (for reports) - Data visualization

## Support & Customization

The system is built to be flexible. You can:

- Add more fields to any table

- Export data to Excel/CSV

## Security Features

✅ Nonce verification on all AJAX requests
