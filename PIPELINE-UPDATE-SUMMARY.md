### 4. Fixed Pipeline Invoices Table Creation

#### Files Created:
- **create-pipeline-tables.sql** - Complete SQL script to create all 6 pipeline tables

#### What It Does:
- Provides a ready-to-run SQL script for phpMyAdmin
- Creates or updates all pipeline tables:
  1. `wp_pipeline_leads`
  2. `wp_pipeline_deals`
  3. `wp_pipeline_invoices` ‚≠ê (This fixes your issue!)
  4. `wp_pipeline_comments`
  5. `wp_pipeline_field_options`
  6. `wp_pipeline_whitelist`
- Includes all default field options

#### How to Use:
1. Open phpMyAdmin
2. Select your WordPress database
3. Go to SQL tab
4. Copy and paste the contents of `create-pipeline-tables.sql`
5. Click "Go" to execute
6. All tables will be created successfully

---

### 5. Partner Company Auto-Population (Already Working)

#### Current Implementation:
- **[invoices.php:378-404](wp-content/themes/houzez/template-parts/pipeline/invoices.php#L378-L404)** - `loadLeadInfo()` function
- **[pipeline-ajax-handlers.php:467-490](wp-content/themes/houzez/inc/pipeline-ajax-handlers.php#L467-L490)** - `get_lead_for_invoice_handler()`

#### How It Works:
1. When you select a client from the dropdown in invoice creation
2. The system automatically loads the lead information via AJAX
3. If the lead has associated partners (from the `partners` field), it auto-selects the first partner in the "Partner Company" dropdown
4. This happens automatically without any user action

## Testing Checklist

### Before Testing:
- [ ] Run the SQL script in phpMyAdmin to create the `wp_pipeline_invoices` table

### Test "Buyer Payment Completed" Status:
- [ ] Go to Deals page
- [ ] Verify "Buyer Payment Completed" shows in statistics cards
- [ ] Edit a deal and change status to "Buyer Payment Completed"
- [ ] Verify the deal still shows in the deals list (since lead is Qualified)
- [ ] Use the filter dropdown to filter by "Buyer Payment Completed"

### Test Invoice Creation:
- [ ] Create a deal with status "Buyer Payment Completed"
- [ ] Go to Invoices page
- [ ] Click "Create New Invoice"
- [ ] Verify the deal appears in "Select Client (From Deals)" dropdown
- [ ] Select the client
- [ ] Verify Partner Company auto-populates (if the lead has a partner associated)

### Test Reports:
- [ ] Go to Reports page
- [ ] Select "Deals Report" from Report Type dropdown
- [ ] Click "Generate Report"
- [ ] Verify statistics show all statuses including "Buyer Payment Completed"

## Important Notes

1. **Database Table**: The `wp_pipeline_invoices` table must be created before you can add invoices. Use the provided SQL script.

2. **Partner Auto-Population**: This feature already exists and works automatically. When creating an invoice:
   - Select a client from the "Select Client (From Deals)" dropdown
   - If that lead has partners associated, the Partner Company will auto-select
   - This pulls from the `partners` field saved when the lead was created

3. **Deal Visibility**: Deals only show in the Deals page when the associated lead has status "Qualified". If you change a lead back to "New Lead" or another status, the deal will disappear from the deals list.

4. **Comments Persistence**: Comments added at the Lead stage will continue to show when viewing the Deal, marked with a "LEAD" badge. Comments added at the Deal stage are marked with a "DEAL" badge.
